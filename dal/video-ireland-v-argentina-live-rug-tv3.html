conference play. That said, their offense is statistically worse than West Virginia‚Äôs, and it could be a real chance for the Eagles to get on the board.It's November, which means that the rubber has officially met the road 

in the race for conference titles and the College Football Playoff. It's time to have some fun, and there will be a lot of it on Saturday afternoon as a full slate of college football fun awaits.No. 20 Auburn will travel to

Buckeyes didn't land in the top four in the initial CFP Rankings, but style points on the road in a hostile environment would help their case. Meanwhile, an upset would be huge for Cornhuskers coach Scott Frost.

No. 20 Auburn at No. 14 West Virginia -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com and CBS Sports App: The SEC on CBS Game of the Week will feature an Auburn team that still controls its own destiny in the SEC West and, if a few more

p.m. on ABC, fuboTV (Try for free): The Huskies haven't lived up to expectations, but the war of words between the two schools heated up this week when coach Jimmy Lake was asked about how the two schools approach recruiting. The

compared to the weeks prior: the first College Football Playoff rankings are out, giving everyone in the list of 25 teams a better idea of where they stand.For Texas, its placement at No. 3 puts it firmly in the race 

for one of the four spots. But a trip to West Lafayette could make that ranking short-lived; Texas has already knocked off one top-10 team this season. Fellow undefeated program Texas, at No. 9 in the playoff rankings, 

has some work to do, and can't afford a slip-up with a visit to Chapel Hill to face UNC.Elsewhere, Auburn and West Virginia battle in a key SEC clash in College Station, Oregon takes on Washington in Seattle, and one-loss
