Buckeyes didn't land in the top four in the initial CFP Rankings, but style points on the road in a hostile environment would help their case. Meanwhile, an upset would be huge for Cornhuskers coach Scott Frost.

No. 20 Auburn at No. 14 West Virginia -- 3:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com and CBS Sports App: The SEC on CBS Game of the Week will feature an Auburn team that still controls its own destiny in the SEC West and, if a few more

for one of the four spots. But a trip to West Lafayette could make that ranking short-lived; Texas has already knocked off one top-10 team this season. Fellow undefeated program Texas, at No. 9 in the playoff rankings,

Everton's and Manchester City's time off is coming to an end as we head into Matchweek 12. They are meeting up for their first leg of the season at 9 a.m. ET on Sunday at Etihad Stadium. Everton hasn't won a contest against Man City since Jan. 15 of 2017, but they'll be looking to end the drought.

Last week, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur ended up with a point apiece after a 0-0 draw.

Meanwhile, Man City got themselves on the board against Manchester United two weeks ago, but Man United never followed suit. Man City beat the Red Devils 2-0. The Manchester City offense checked out after the first half but had enough goals banked to take the match anyway.

After their draw, Everton will be looking to earn the full three points in this match.

The Washington Spirit are 2021 NWSL champions after defeating Chicago Red Stars 2-1 in extra time. Spirit players Andi Sullivan and Kelley O'Hara scored goals for the club in the victory. 

It is the first championship title for the Spirit franchise, and it comes after an exceptionally long year, both on and off the field. They survived the termination of the former head coach Richie Burke, a month long absence of play, including two forfeits due to violating Covid-19 protocols, and fighting between the ownership group in the wake of those investigations which led to the resignation of primary owner Steve Baldwin after a letter from players demanded change. 

For the Red Stars, it is the second time they've come up one win short. The club has made the NWSL playoffs six consecutive times, including an appearance in the inaugural 2020 Challenge Cup final, abut still find themselves on the hunt for their first ever NWSL trophy.

After the match some players from both sides had thoughts about where their respective sides go from here.

While the Spirit's controversies have been well covered, this was not an easy year for Chicago either. For a team that spent the season losing key players like Julie Ertz to injury, the fact that Vaness DiBernardo was forced off after 15 minutes and Mallory Pugh at halftime must have seemed par for the course. After all, they made it to the finals without Pugh who missed the semifinals thanks to Covid-19 protocols. Yet the team fought their way to another final, with perhaps what many considered their best shot at a trophy despite all of the setbacks. The roster has plenty of players who have been in this scenario before, while others it's their first time.

For winger, and finals goal scorer Rachel Hill, coming up short again doesn't change what she thinks about this group. "I wanted to be at Chicago because I know they're a team of winners. And getting to the final of the Challenge Cup, and then again this year that's exactly why I came here," she said. "This club just continues to win and make it far. We'll win the whole thing someday, but I think just being here and being around a group that knows how to win games and knows how to stick together through it has been incredible.
