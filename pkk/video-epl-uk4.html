Manchester City are back in Premier League action today, taking on Everton at the Etihad Stadium (2pm).

Pep Guardiola 's City need to make up ground on Chelsea, who pulled six points clear at the top of the Premier League table after beating Leicester City on Saturday.

Man City head into today's match on the back of a comfortable 2-0 defeat of Manchester United with any lingering doubts after a shock reverse to Crystal Palace the game before that banished.

Everton, meanwhile, have seen their form spiral after a good start to Rafa Benitez's time in charge at Goodison Park.

They have not won since September 25 and have lost three of their last four games.

The Manchester Evening News will bring full coverage of the Premier League clash on our live blog below, with pre-match build-up, live match updates and reaction to come.
After Russell Wilson missed three games with a broken finger and Aaron Rodgers was forced out last week because of COVID-19, both the Manchester City and Everton will be happy to get their franchise quarterbacks back on Sunday. The Everton are 7-2 on the season, while the Manchester City have work to do to get back into the NFC playoff picture after a 3-5 start.
Kickoff for Manchester City vs. Everton is set for 4:25 p.m. ET at Lambeau Field. Caesars Sportsbook lists Green Bay as a three-point favorite in the latest Everton vs. Manchester City odds, while the over-under for total points is 49. In select markets, Sunday's matchup
It's now official: Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson will start at quarterback opposite one another for the ninth time on Sunday afternoon.
On one side, Rodgers returns from a bout with COVID-19 after missing the Everton (-3)
This will be Aaron Rodgers’ 199th career regular-season start. In Sunday Night Football history, he is third with a 104.0 passer rating and first with a 4.66-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. This season, Rodgers is sixth with a 105.7 passer rating.
This will be Russell Wilson’s 190th career regular-season start. He is fourth in Sunday Night Football history with a 102.3 passer rating and third with a 3.38-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. This season, Wilson leads the Sunday Night Football with a 125.3 rating – a whopping 19.3 points better than No. 2 Matthew Stafford of the Rams.
' last game a week ago in LA. On the other, Wilson is back after missing three games with a more conventEvertonl injury, a banged-up middle finger on his throwing hand.
The two returns bring intrigue back to a matchup between one of the NFC's consistent powerhouses and another franchise that is typically among the conference's elite but has slipped this season. Read on below for all the details on how to tune in for today's premier matchup in the late afternoon time slot.
Wilson’s 199-game starts streak was snapped due to the finger injury that sidelined him for three games.
“The first game was the hardest game because I had a goal in my head to play the most consecutive games ever, but sometimes things change, life changes and things happen,” he said. “It was definitely an experience. You look at the game in a different way because, for 190-plus games, I’ve been sitting back here and processing everything from there. I can understand the game from a different perspective, too.”

Good afternoon, hope you're having a restful Sunday, we have got some Premier League football for you, and it's mighty Manchester City who are the focus of attention here. They welcome Everton to the Etihad for a 2pm kick off. In between now and then, we'll have a bit of build up and the team news at 1pm

Man City fans, I am sure, must be feeling pretty low today with the news that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is on his bike; he really has been a thoroughly enjoyable appointment for the blue half of the city. Anyway, you can follow our live blog about the fall-out from  Manchester United sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on that there blog, where we also run the rule over the potential replacements.

To the matter at hand: City can go above Liverpool with a win over Everton, and claim second spot. Could be a splendid three-way Title race by the looks of things. Chelsea look seriously strong. Today's visitors, Everton, have got some problems: they have no win in the last five, and have lost three of those against teams they really ought to be beating if they want to establish themselves in the top six. Letting in five at home to Watford is a shocker. Can't say that Man City would be your first choice if you wanted to get your form back.

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola used some time in the build up to this to say that Bernardo Silva is currently "undroppable".

Guardiola said: "Right now he's undroppable because of what he is doing on the pitch. Sometimes Bernardo didn't play in the last (two) seasons because he was not undroppable, because he was not on the level.

"But the year we won 98 points in the league, he was the best - and I think it's coming back.

"What he has done this season - it is difficult to find in Europe, in the world, a player like him right now.

"I have the feeling now he is happy here, with his personal life and hopefully he can have an exceptional season with us again.

"He can play in six positions. He can play holding midfielder, attacking midfielder, winger, striker, false nine and the other winger.

"He can play everywhere because he is so smart, so intuitive, so intelligent."

Everton return to Premier League action this afternoon when they take on Manchester City at the Etihad.

The Blues come into the game on the back of a 0-0 draw with Tottenham in their last outing and currently sit 12th in the table.

Rafa Benitez confirmed on Friday that Yerry Mina, Andre Gomes, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Dominic-Calvert Lewin will all miss the game.

Everton are also concerned that Tom Davies could face a spell on the sidelines with a knee injury ahead of this afternoon’s game.

While Pep Guardiola confirmed on Friday that Kevin De Bruyne will miss the game after testing positive for coronavirus while away on international duty with Belgium.

Kicking off at 2pm, and live on Sky Sports, Phil Kirkbride, Adam Jones and Sam Carroll will all be on hand to provide live updates on the action as well as bring you team news, analysis and reaction from the Etihad.
Follow live updates as Manchester City host Everton in the early kick-off on Sunday in the Premier League with Pep Guardiola’s side eager to build on their dominant victory over Manchester United before the international break.

City had far too much in the Manchester derby, with the 2-0 win not reflecting their superiority at Old Trafford, with goals from a Eric Bailly own-goal and Bernardo Silva.


The Toffees, understrength due to injuries, ground out a point at home to Tottenham in Antonio Conte’s first Premier League match in charge, but Rafa Benitez will be keen to build momentum heading into the festive period now and move up from their mid-table position to challenge for a Europa League place.

Guardiola took time to praise Joao Cancelo in the build-up to this weekend’s game, but insists he demands more from the Portuguese as a key part to his team: “Of course he’s playing really well, consistent. Especially with his physicality, he can recover really fast and well during the games. He can play every three days without any problem. But, at the same time, I have the feeling he can do better. Still there are margins to improve in some aspects that we have been working on with him since he arrived. I’m pretty sure he is open to accept it and we can move forward.”
